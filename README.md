# mern-portfolio
An awesome fullstack web portfolio, the first I built was really simple, but this is pretty damn good.

## Â¿Hos was did build it?
As I said, this is a web fullstack project using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The architecture pattern is REST API, which means that the frontend is a single page application, and the backend is a REST API.

## Goals Completed
* Build a web portfolio completily dinamic using MERN.
* Implement a REST API to manage the data and then integrate it with the frontend.

## Observations
* As you can see, the .env file is not here because of this is a good practice for the security of the app. The variables of each .env (there are one for front and one for back) are these:  
  
### Backend  
  > DATABASE= your connection string  
  > PORT= your port  
  > FRONTEND_URL= your frontend url  

### Frontend  
  > REACT_APP_API_URL= your backend url

* To run the API, just run the following command in your terminal  
  `node .\index.js`
* To run the frontend, just run the following command in your terminal  
  `npm start`  
* You can use Postman to do the http requests to the REST API

## Tech
* React
* Bootstrap
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* Postman
